# Z80.NET+#


## Overview ##

Based on the Z80dotNet by Konamiman, this is a GUI tool designed to aid in accurate simulation of various Z80 configurations,
involving Logic Gates, Switches, LEDs, Serial Terminals & LCDs. 

## Features & Release Date ##

Currently this project is not yet released (but is in active development!).
Currently planned features are:

- [ ] Assembled/Dissassembled view with breakpoints
- [ ] On the run code modification (requires pausing)
- [ ] Attachable peripherals API (with custom components)
- [ ] Serial terminal with configurable baud rate
- [ ] Serial LCD
- [ ] Ability to create mini logic gate circuits
- [ ] Integrated assembler
- [ ] Integrated SDCC compiler
